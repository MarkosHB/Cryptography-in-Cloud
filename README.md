# Cryptography-in-Cloud

The final work done in the [Theory-of-Information-and-Coding-Subject](https://github.com/MarkosHB/Theory-of-Information-and-Coding-Subject) was to introduce to the auditory a current application of the encryption and decryption process. This repository has two main sections:
- [Report](https://github.com/MarkosHB/Cryptography-in-Cloud/blob/main/Cryptography%20in%20Cloud%20-%20Documentation.pdf). Document prepared where the conclusions of the investigation are collected.
- [Slides](https://github.com/MarkosHB/Cryptography-in-Cloud/blob/main/Cryptography%20in%20Cloud%20-%20Slides.pdf). Easy to see and understand. As it is said "less sometimes is more".
